# Employee Directory App

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of 25 employees renders. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by each category.

  * Filter the users by each category.
